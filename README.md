# Shoppify-Internship-Movie-Project
This is a front end development of a website that displays movies when searched by a key word, and saves a set of nominated movies.

To see the hosted webpage, view here: https://cranky-sammet-2088b3.netlify.app/

The website is not usable at the moment becuase omdbapi is not https://, trying to find a way to mask the website to be able to host it
